/**
 * We still can utilize parallelity without assuming an infinite amount
 * of resources. A KISS approach to do this, is to apply an upper bound
 * to what we do in parallel. And thats what this class tries to assist
 * with. It wants to be that tool that allows parallelity but maintains
 * upper bounds. For stone-age programmers: It's nothing else than a
 * semaphore really. But decorated with a vertx gift bow to make it fit
 * better in the new framework world ;)
 *
 * Long story:
 *
 * Level 1: KISS says do everything sequentially. Stop here! You're
 * done! "Optimization is the root of all evil" you know? Happy you. So
 * just do NOT use this class if this is the case for your use case.
 *
 * Level 2: There are cases where we do not have the time to do
 * everything sequentially. The next step is to go parallel and/or
 * concurrent (I don't care which term you think is the correct one.
 * Just take the one that fits your opinion better). But by going
 * parallel, we just assume we have an infinite amount of resources
 * available (eg sockets, memory, CPU time, ...), so we can happily fill
 * queues to an infinite number of entries without running in trouble
 * ever. In case your resources are infinite, happy you you're done.
 *
 * Level 3: Welcome in my world. Where reality starts to hit you sooner or
 * later and you'll realize no matter how much of those "infinite cloud
 * resources" and fancy frameworks magic you throw at your problem, it won't
 * solve the issue. Performance-is-not-an-issue? Please, just go back to
 * "Level 1" and be happy there.
